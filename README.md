# Gender Stereotypes in e-commerce systems

*Executive Summary*

The main goal of this current research in collaboration with Boise State University is to draw attention to the presence of gender stereotypes in non-US-based e-commerce systems and its impact on the experience and behaviors of users searching for children’s toys.
 Ultimately, the project’s minimum viable product is a well-formatted dataset created from scraping two UK-based e-commerce systems. This dataset will demonstrate how search results are impacted by specific, gendered queries. The two e-commerce systems analyzed will be Amazon UK and Argos to provide international data to expand the already existing research.
PIReT will compare the Amazon UK and Argos’ query suggestions and search results data to existing U.S.-based data to further analyze the presence of gender stereotypes. Our notebooks document the queries from the international sites, and have clear documentation of the code to ensure the process can be replicated for other websites in the future.
